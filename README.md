# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++  

This repository contains examples and projects that demonstrate the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++. It serves as a learning resource for mastering OOP principles and applying them to real-world programming scenarios.  

## üìå Features  
The repository covers the following OOP concepts in C++:  
1. **Classes and Objects:**  
   - Defining classes and creating objects.  
   - Accessing members (methods and attributes).  

2. **Encapsulation:**  
   - Using access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).  
   - Implementing getter and setter methods.  

3. **Inheritance:**  
   - Understanding single and multilevel inheritance.  
   - Exploring `public`, `protected`, and `private` inheritance.  

4. **Polymorphism:**  
   - Function overloading.  
   - Operator overloading.  
   - Virtual functions and runtime polymorphism.  

5. **Abstraction:**  
   - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.  

6. **Other Advanced Topics:**  
   - Constructor and Destructor.  
   - Copy constructors and assignment operators.  
   - Dynamic memory management using pointers.
